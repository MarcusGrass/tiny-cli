# Tiny-cli
A minimal macro supporting arg-parsing, mostly intended for use with [tiny-std](https://github.com/MarcusGrass/tiny-std).

## Features

1. Required args.
2. Optional args.
3. Repeating args.
4. Subcommands.
5. Minimal help-docs.
6. `no_std`
7. No proc macros.

## Recommendations
Don't use this if you don't need to, if you need a full-featured arg-parser, [clap](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/)
will likely give you less of a headache.
